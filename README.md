# Gromacs_Plot
Colab notebook to generate plots from gromacs .xvg files

Based on my personal struggle in generating a plot from gromacs result (.xvg) files, I (with the help of my buddy ChatGPT) create a colab notebook. This helps a lot especially when you have plenty of plots to generate.

## How to use?
Upload your.xvg files and run the code for each section


You can open my notebook in Google Colab by clicking the link below:
